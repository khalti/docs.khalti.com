Signup as merchant 2. Understand how khalti payment works 3. Test integration 3.1. Client side integration 3.2. Server side integration 4. Deploy integration 1. Signup as merchant \u00b6 First of all you will need a merchant and a consumer accounts. Merchant is an online business service like e-commerce websites, ISP online payment, Movie online purchase etc. Consumer is an end user who uses Khalti to purchase products or services from merchants. Please follow links below to create a merchant and a consumer accounts if you have not already. Create a merchant account Create a consumer account 2. Understand Khalti payment process \u00b6 3. Test integration \u00b6 Now that you know how Khalti payment works. Its time to integrate it into your system. A merchant must complete test integration using test keys. Test keys start with test_ . In test mode, transactions are sandboxed, which means fund is not moved from a consumer to the merchant. Khalti must to be integrated at client and server. A transaction has three states initiate, confirm and complete. A client initiates and confirms payment while server verifies it and payment process is completed. Payment via E-Banking and Debit/Credit card is not supported in test environment. After you successfully integrate wallet, you need not to concern about E-Banking and Card payment integration. 3.1. Client side integration \u00b6 For now there is only one way to integrate Khalti at client side, through SDKs. We have developed SDKs for every major plaforms and we call it Checkout . Checkouts provide all the necessary UIs and perform necessary processes to initiate and confirm payment. Web Android iOS 3.2. Server side integration \u00b6 After user confirms payment, it has to be verified by Khalti. Fund from user's account is moved to merchant only if verification succeeds. Verification must be done by the merchant server using a secret key. Verification API Transaction API 4. Deploy integration \u00b6 After successful integration test, the merchant must replace test keys with live ones. Live keys start with live_X_X . Replace test_public_X and test_secret_X keys with live_public_X and live_secret_X keys respectively. 4.1. Further processes \u00b6 Even successful integration itself doesn't let you receive payments above NRs. 1000 per transaction.

Once they've confirmed the payment, the client will receive a response containing unique token and amount for that particular transaction. Upon receiving the transaction token, the client will make a request to your server with the token and the payment amount. On the next step, you will need to ask the Khalti server to verify the information relayed by the user before completing their purchase order. Why is server-to-server verification necessary? \u00b6 Since the client side makes the payment directly to Khalti without going through your server first, you need to be sure that the customer actually paid the money they were supposed to before completing their order. This type of verification can only be done securely from the server. Verification request \u00b6 Your application server must do a POST request to Khalti server for the final step of the payment process.

First and foremost, please read the docs at http://docs.khalti.com to understand the basic workflow of the merchant API. API \u00b6 1. Get Bank List \u00b6 This API provides the bank list. The request signature for initiation is as follows: URL: https://khalti.com/api/bank/?has_ebanking=true Method: GET The response contains list of banks with the details as shown below. { ... \"records\": [ { \"idx\": \"Yy6jFwuwssihs77PHGjwAZ\", \"name\": \"<Bank Name>\", \"short_name\": \"<Truncated Name>\", \"logo\": \"<logo source>\", \"has_cardpayment\": false, \"address\": \"<Bank address>\", \"has_ebanking\": true, \"has_direct_withdraw\": false, \"has_nchl\": false, \"has_mobile_banking\": false, \"play_store\": \"\", \"app_store\": \"\" } ] } 2. Initiate transaction \u00b6 As the title says, this API is called to initiates the transaction. E.g. When the user clicks Checkout button, you will need to prompt for their Khalti registered mobile number, and call this API once the payer submits. The request signature for initiation is as follows: URL: https://khalti.com/ebanking/initiate/ Method: POST Data: public_key : Required. Either test or live public key. mobile : Required. The Khalti registered mobile number of payer. amount : Required. The amount value of payment. Needs to be in paisa. product_identity : Required. A string to identify the product. product_name : Required. Descriptive name for the product.false bank :Required.A bank idx, source :Required. web, android, ios, or custom, return_url :Optional. It is required if source key is custom or ios . return_url for ios platform creates a url scheme for browser to open current app and if for custom redirects window to this url with data, Additional information about the product can be passed along with this for reporting purposes. The keys for additional data must be prefixed with merchant_ . A sample request adhering to the above signature will look something like this: { \"public_key\": \"live_public_key_546eb6da05544d7d88961db04fdb9721\", \"mobile\": \"9842XXXXXX\", \"amount\": 10000, \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", \"bank\": \"Yy6jFwuwssihs77PHGjwAZ\", \"source\": \"web\" } With this request khalti server will redirect your client to bank portal where user can access e-banking, finally redirecting back to original/parent page with the response. \u00b6 Data Retrival \u00b6 Once transaction is initated, user interacts with ebanking system. After transaction is completed getting success or failure response is tricky. There are different ways based on different source . Android For android it returns data with the intent intent://ebanking/#Intent;scheme=khalti;package=<return_url>;S.data=<data>;S.browser_fallback_url=https://khalti.com/;end IOS For ios you need to provide return_url and response data is binded with it. Finally, custom url for the action is <return_url>://?<data> Custom If you have provided return url and source as custom as following: { ... \"return_url\": \"http://example.bookshop.com/\", \"source\": \"custom\" } You will then get redirection to return_url with data as below. <return_url>/?<data> Web And with web response data is stored in local storage with localstorage.setItem(\"confirmation-data\", {{data}}) The storage event is fired when a storage area (localStorage or sessionStorage) has been modified. So, while implementing it needs to listen the storage event and read localstorage value as data with the key confirmation-data . The example is like this: window.addEventListener(\"storage\", function (event) { if (event.key == \"confirmation-data\") { data = JSON.parse(event.newValue); // this is the final response with looks json shown below window.localStorage.removeItem(\"confirmation-data\"); } }); Finally, a successful request will yield a response that looks something like this: { \"token\": \"VGMyaKVDQQyorBiQ3W99WL\", \"amount\": 10000, \"mobile\": \"98XXXXX099\", \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" } 3. Verify transaction \u00b6 The API requests mentioned in previous steps are to be made from the client side i.e. from the front-end. Once those steps are complete, you need to make a verification request using your secret key from the server. See http://docs.khalti.com/api/verification/ for more information on how to verify the transaction. Notes \u00b6 While testing you might need to interact with actual system of banks. There is no sandbox or testing environment for using ebanking system. Prevent parent page (that initiates redirection) for closing until payment process is not completed. You will not get final response unless bank portal provides success/response message.","title":"Ebanking"},{"location":"checkout/diy-ebanking/#introduction","text":"This document explains the various requests to implement ebanking payment system using Khalti.

Finally, custom url for the action is <return_url>://?<data> Custom If you have provided return url and source as custom as following: { ... \"return_url\": \"http://example.bookshop.com/\", \"source\": \"custom\" } You will then get redirection to return_url with data as below. <return_url>/?<data> Web And with web response data is stored in local storage with localstorage.setItem(\"confirmation-data\", {{data}}) The storage event is fired when a storage area (localStorage or sessionStorage) has been modified. So, while implementing it needs to listen the storage event and read localstorage value as data with the key confirmation-data . The example is like this: window.addEventListener(\"storage\", function (event) { if (event.key == \"confirmation-data\") { data = JSON.parse(event.newValue); // this is the final response with looks json shown below window.localStorage.removeItem(\"confirmation-data\"); } }); Finally, a successful request will yield a response that looks something like this: { \"token\": \"VGMyaKVDQQyorBiQ3W99WL\", \"amount\": 10000, \"mobile\": \"98XXXXX099\", \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" }","title":"Data Retrival"},{"location":"checkout/diy-ebanking/#3-verify-transaction","text":"The API requests mentioned in previous steps are to be made from the client side i.e. from the front-end.

Initiate transaction \u00b6 As the title says, this API is called to initiates the transaction. E.g. When the user clicks Checkout button, you will need to prompt for their Khalti registered mobile number, and call this API once the payer submits. The request signature for initiation is as follows: URL: https://khalti.com/api/payment/initiate/ Method: POST Data: public_key : Required. Either test or live public key. mobile : Required. The Khalti registered mobile number of payer. amount : Required. The amount value of payment. Needs to be in paisa. product_identity : Required. A string to identify the product. product_name : Required. Descriptive name for the product. Additional information about the product can be passed along with this for reporting purposes. The keys for additional data must be prefixed with merchant_ . A sample request adhering to the above signature will look something like this: { \"public_key\": \"live_public_key_546eb6da05544d7d88961db04fdb9721\", \"mobile\": \"9842XXXXXX\", \"amount\": 10000, \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" } The response will be something like this: { \"token\": \"BVNKCiLZhZipkMGws5hgS8\", \"pin_created\": true, \"pin_created_message\": \"Your third party transaction pin has been generated and sent to your mobile number.\" } The response will contain pin_created and pin_created_message if this is the user's first ever third party transaction. You should display the message if pin_created = true and ignore it otherwise. If the user's pin has already been created, the response will look like this: { \"token\": \"VGMyaKVDQQyorBiQ3W99WL\", \"pin_created\": false, \"pin_created_message\": \"\" } 2. Confirm transaction \u00b6 In this step, you will need to prompt the user for the OTP (One Time Password), and their 3rd party transaction pin.
