Signup as merchant 2. Understand how khalti payment works 3. Test integration 3.1. Client side integration 3.2. Server side integration 4. Deploy integration 1. Signup as merchant \u00b6 First of all you will need a merchant and a consumer accounts. Merchant is an online business service like e-commerce websites, ISP online payment, Movie online purchase etc. Consumer is an end user who uses Khalti to purchase products or services from merchants. Please follow links below to create a merchant and a consumer accounts if you have not already. Create a merchant account Create a consumer account 2. Understand Khalti payment process \u00b6 2.1. Transaction States \u00b6 1. Initiated \u00b6 It is the first state of a transaction. Transactions are initiated after mobile number and khalti pin along with other transaction details are provided. 2. Confirmed \u00b6 A transaction is confirmed after transaction details (transaction token, confirmation_code and 3rd party transaction_pin) are provided by the consumer. Check how to set and update khalti pin here. 3. Completed \u00b6 Merchant server then requests khalti server to verify the transaction. After the transaction is in completed state consumer is informed the transaction was successfully completed. 4. Disabled \u00b6 A transaction could be disabled due to the possibility of 'confirmation_code' exploitation. 5. Refunded \u00b6 A merchant can refund the successful payments within a limited period of time. 6. Partially refunded \u00b6 A completed transaction also can be partially refunded. 7. Failed \u00b6 Normally, a successful transaction has at least three changes of states initiate, confirm and complete. A client first initiates and then confirms payment while the server finally verifies it and the payment process is completed. 3. Test integration \u00b6 Now that you know how Khalti payment works. Its time to integrate it into your system. A merchant must complete test integration using test keys . Test keys start with test_ . In test mode, transactions are sandboxed, which means fund is not moved from a consumer to the merchant. Khalti must to be integrated at client and server. Payment via E-Banking and Debit/Credit card is not supported in the test environment. After you successfully integrate wallet, you need not to concern about E-Banking and Card payment integration. 3.1. Client side integration \u00b6 For now there is only one way to integrate Khalti at client side, through SDKs. We have developed SDKs for every major plaforms and we call it Checkout . Checkouts provide all the necessary UIs and perform necessary processes to initiate and confirm payment. Web kit Android kit iOS kit 3.2. Server side integration \u00b6 After user confirms payment, it has to be verified by Khalti. Fund from user account is moved to merchant only if verification succeeds. Verification must be done by the merchant server using a secret key. Verification API Transaction API 4. Go live \u00b6 After successful integration test, live keys will be generated in the merchant dashboard. The merchant must replace test keys with live ones . Live keys start with live_X . Replace test_public_X and test_secret_X keys with live_public_X and live_secret_X keys respectively. 4.1. Further processes \u00b6 Even successful integration itself doesn't let you receive payments above NRs. 1000 per transaction.

Does Khalti have SDK for hybrid Apps? For the hybrid app, we don't have a specific SDK. Find options in Client Integration , which support Khalti checkout integration with your app. 2. Can I share merchant keys? Secret key must not be shared with anyone. Ensure it does not get leaked by any means. If you key got compromised you can regenerate new one from your merchant dashboard. 3. Can I integrate Khalti in my static/HTML website? Complete Khalti integration in Static/HTML site is not possible. If the currently available options failed to meet your requirement leave us your feedback . 4. While installing the plugin I got an issue. How can I resolve it? First, check if cURL is enabled. You should check if you miss out any dependency or extension. There might be common SSL issues. You can also tweak the code (of the plugin you got from GitHub) on your own. For debugging paste this in your code to get the configuration and predefined variables. <?php phpinfo();?> Also, see your server log. 5. What is Khalti PIN? Khalti pin is the four digit pin, used by the user while making payment of third party transactions. It can created or changed at the Transaction Pin section under Account in khalti web and Settings in khalti app. 6. I need to refund payment to the user. How can I refund a transaction? You can refund the payment to the user from your dashboard. gotchas \u00b6 CORS issues If you are getting CORS issues, read the docs again very thoroughly. You need to call verification API from your server to verify, so it is necessary to pass the data to your server first. Server errors If you get error response \"Fee not found.\" while testing, check your fee and set fee between Rs. 10 to Rs. 1000. If you are using live keys contact merchant support to find your transaction limits. Payment errors If you get error response \"Amount must be less than 1000.\" while testing, check you have complete all the contract process. If you are using live keys contact merchant support for further details. Frame Options and Clickjacking protection Refused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'. You are using HTTP response header 'X-Frame-Options' that avoids <iframe> rendering when you set it to 'deny'. But Khalti gateway uses iframe payment form, to accept payment from Khalti you need to allow iframe at least for khalti.com. You have a configuration option 'allow-from' with x-frame-options to allow from a specific domain. You can simply do this in your server configuration: X-Frame-Options \"allow-from https://khalti.com\" But using x-frame-options is not an internet standard. It is almost absolute; modern browsers like chrome and safari don't support it. The recommended way is to use 'frame-ancestors' CSP rule. (legacy browsers like IE do not support it ). So also for this error: Refused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"frame-ancestors 'none'\".

Initiate transaction \u00b6 As the title says, this API is called to initiates the transaction. E.g. When the user clicks Checkout button, you will need to prompt for their Khalti registered mobile number, and call this API once the payer submits. The request signature for initiation is as follows: URL: https://khalti.com/ebanking/initiate/ Method: POST Data: public_key : Required. Either test or live public key. mobile : Required.

A string to identify the product. product_name : Required. Descriptive name for the product.false bank :Required.A bank idx, source :Required. web, android, ios, or custom, return_url :Optional. It is required if source key is custom or ios . return_url for ios platform creates a url scheme for browser to open current app and if for custom redirects window to this url with data, Additional information about the product can be passed along with this for reporting purposes. The keys for additional data must be prefixed with merchant_ . A sample request adhering to the above signature will look something like this: { \"public_key\": \"live_public_key_546eb6da05544d7d88961db04fdb9721\", \"mobile\": \"9842XXXXXX\", \"amount\": 10000, \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", \"bank\": \"Yy6jFwuwssihs77PHGjwAZ\", \"source\": \"web\" } With this request khalti server will redirect your client to bank portal where user can access e-banking, finally redirecting back to original/parent page with the response. Data Retrival \u00b6 Once transaction is initated, user interacts with ebanking system. After transaction is completed getting success or failure response is tricky. There are different ways based on different source . Android For android it returns data with the intent intent://ebanking/#Intent;scheme=khalti;package=<return_url>;S.data=<data>;S.browser_fallback_url=https://khalti.com/;end IOS For ios you need to provide return_url and response data is binded with it. Finally, custom url for the action is <return_url>://?<data> Custom If you have provided return url and source as custom as following: { ... \"return_url\": \"http://example.bookshop.com/\", \"source\": \"custom\" } You will then get redirection to return_url with data as below. <return_url>/?<data> Web And with web response data is stored in local storage with localstorage.setItem(\"confirmation-data\", {{data}}) The storage event is fired when a storage area (localStorage or sessionStorage) has been modified. So, while implementing it needs to listen the storage event and read localstorage value as data with the key confirmation-data . The example is like this: window.addEventListener(\"storage\", function (event) { if (event.key == \"confirmation-data\") { data = JSON.parse(event.newValue); // this is the final response with looks json shown below window.localStorage.removeItem(\"confirmation-data\"); } }); Finally, a successful request will yield a response that looks something like this: { \"token\": \"VGMyaKVDQQyorBiQ3W99WL\", \"amount\": 10000, \"mobile\": \"98XXXXX099\", \"product_identity\": \"book/id-120\", \"product_name\": \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" } 3. Verify transaction \u00b6 The API requests mentioned in previous steps are to be made from the client side i.e. from the front-end. Once those steps are complete, you need to make a verification request using your secret key from the server. See http://docs.khalti.com/api/verification/ for more information on how to verify the transaction. Notes \u00b6 While testing you might need to interact with actual system of banks. There is no sandbox or testing environment for using ebanking system. Prevent parent page (that initiates redirection) for closing until payment process is not completed.

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile: pod 'Khalti' Usage \u00b6 Adding CustomSchme \u00b6 Khalti uses custom Scheme: So merhant should setup URLScheme unique for their app. We have made usability as of user case. After adding Url Scheme create global constant for same customUrlScheme as below let khaltiUrlScheme:String = \"KhaltiPayExampleScheme\" Requirements \u00b6 To work around with this redirection you have to implement some openUrl in Appdelegate.swift . Khalti.shared.defaultAction() returns true if you initiate payment through Khalti. Khalti.shared.action(with: url) is needed for complete action after ebanking and card payment. Note: Using Khalti.shared.action(with: url) is mandatory. Add following code to Appdelegate.swift func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool { Khalti.shared.action(with: url) return Khalti.shared.defaultAction() // Or true } Using at particular ViewController \u00b6 At your viewController during action of pay add initiate config file When instantiating Config pass public key, product id, product name, amount (in paisa).
