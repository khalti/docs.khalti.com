# Web Checkout (New E-Payment Version)

This documentation details the process of implementing the latest e-Payment Checkout platform released by Khalti.The latest version is accessible through [pay.khalti.com](https://pay.khalti.com)

## How it works?  

- User visits the merchant's website to make some purchase
- A unique `purchase_order_id` is generated at merchant's system
- Payment request is made to Khalti providing the `purchase_order_id`, `amount` in paisa and `return_url`
- User is redirected to the epayment portal (eg. https://pay.khalti.com)
- After payment is made by the user, a successful callback is made to the `return_url`
- The merchant website can optionally confirm the payment received
- The merchant website then proceeds other steps after payment confirmation

## Getting Started

There is no special installation plugin or SDK required for this provided you are able to make a POST request from your web application. However, we shall come up with handy plugins in coming days.

!!! tip

    A merchant account is required if you haven't created at.

!!! info "Access Information"

    > **For Sandbox Access**

    Signup from [https://a.khalti.com/join/merchant/](https://a.khalti.com/join/merchant/) as a merchant.

    > **For Production Access**

    Please visit [https://admin.khalti.com](https://admin.khalti.com)

## API Authorization
HTTP Authorization for api requests is done using Auth Keys. Auth Key must be passed in the  header for authorization in the following format 

```json
{
 	"Authorization": "Key <LIVE_SECRET_KEY>"  
}  
```

!!! tip

    Use `live_secret_key` from __a.khalti.com__ during sandbox testing and use `live_secret_key` from __khalti.com__ for production environments.
