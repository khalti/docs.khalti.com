## Launching Payment Interface

### Generating the pidx
A unique product identifier `pidx` must be generated via a server side POST request before being able to proceed. Read [here](https://docs.khalti.com/khalti-epayment/#initiating-a-payment-request) for information on how one can generate pidx along with other extra parameters.

### Khalti Initialization
Before being able to launch Khalti payment gateway, it is necessary to initialize `Khalti` object. The initialization can be done by a static `init()` method.

It is suggested that the initialization be done inside the `initState` method of a `StatefulWidget`.

```dart
class KhaltiSDKDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  const KhaltiSDKDemo({super.key});

  @override
  State<KhaltiSDKDemo> createState() => _KhaltiSDKDemoState();
}

class _KhaltiSDKDemoState extends State<KhaltiSDKDemo> {
  late final Future<Khalti> khalti;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    final payConfig = KhaltiPayConfig(
      publicKey: '__live_public_key__', // Merchant's public key
      pidx: pidx, // This should be generated via a server side POST request.
      environment: Environment.prod,
    );

    khalti = Khalti.init(
      enableDebugging: true,
      payConfig: payConfig,
      onPaymentResult: (paymentResult, khalti) {
        log(paymentResult.toString());
      },
      onMessage: (
        khalti, {
        description,
        statusCode,
        event,
        needsPaymentConfirmation,
      }) async {
        log(
          'Description: $description, Status Code: $statusCode, Event: $event, NeedsPaymentConfirmation: $needsPaymentConfirmation',
        );
      },
      onReturn: () => log('Successfully redirected to return_url.'),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Rest of the code
  }
}
```

!!! warning "BREAKING CHANGE"

    Starting with version `1.0.0-dev.5`, it is no longer necessary for the developers to manually add `return_url` within `KhaltiPayConfig`. The SDK handles the fetching and proper usage of `return_url`.
    
The static `init()` method takes in a few arguments:

- **enableDebugging**: A boolean argument that is when set to true can be used to view network logs in the debug console. It is set to `false` by default.
- **payConfig**: An instance of `KhaltiPayConfig()`. It is used to set few config data. The instance of `KhaltiPayConfig` takes in few arguments:

    ```dart
    final payConfig = KhaltiPayConfig(
      publicKey: '__live_public_key__', // Merchant's public key
      pidx: pidx, // This should be generated via a server side POST request.
      environment: Environment.prod,
    );
    ```
  
    - **publicKey**: Merchant's live or test public key provided by Khalti.
    - **pidx**: Unique product identifier received after initiating the payment via a server-side POST request.
    - **environment**: An enum that determines whether test API or production API should be invoked. Can be either `Environment.prod` or `Environment.test`. Set to `Environment.prod` by default.

- **onPaymentResult**: A callback function that is triggered if the payment is successfully made and redirected to merchant's return URL. The callback takes in two arguments.
    - **paymentResult**: An instance of `PaymentResult` class. It provides some informations about the payment after it is successfully made. Following data is provided by this instance.
        - **payload**: An instance of `PaymentPayload`. It contains general informations such as `pidx`, `totalAmount`, `transactionId`, `status`, `fee`, `refunded`, `purchaseOrderId`, `purchaseOrderName` and `extraMerchantParams` regarding the payment made. 
    - **khalti**: An instance of `Khalti`. Can be used to invoke any methods provided by this instance.

    ```dart
    onPaymentResult(paymentResult, khalti) {
      print(paymentResult.payload?.status);
      print(paymentResult.payload?.pidx);
      print(paymentResult.payload?.totalAmount);
      print(paymentResult.payload?.transactionId);
    }
    ```
  
- **onReturn**: A callback function that gets triggered when the return_url is successfully loaded.

- **onMessage**: A callback function that is triggered to convey any message. It gets triggered when any issue is encountered or when any general message is to be conveyed. In case of error, this callback provides error informations such as error description and status code. It also provides information about why the error occured via `KhaltiEvent` enum. This enum consists of:
  
    ```dart
    enum KhaltiEvent {
      /// Event for when khalti payment page is disposed.
      kpgDisposed,

      /// Event for when return url fails to load from the API.
      returnUrlLoadFailure,

      /// Event for when there's an exception when making a network call.
      networkFailure,

      /// Event for when there's a HTTP failure when making a network call for verifying payment status.
      paymentLookupfailure,

      /// An unknown event.
      unknown
    }
    ```
  Additionally, it also provides a bool `needsPaymentConfirmation` which needs to be checked. If it is true, developers should invoke payment confirmation API that is provided by the SDK to confirm the status of their payment. The callback also provides the instance of `Khalti`.

    ```dart
    onMessage: (
      khalti, {
      description,
      statusCode,
      event,
      needsPaymentConfirmation,
    }) {
      log('Description: $description, Status Code: $statusCode, Event: $event, NeedsPaymentConfirmation: $needsPaymentConfirmation');
    }
    ```

### Loading payment interface
The SDK internally uses [flutter_inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview) to load the khalti payment gateway. SDK users should invoke `open()` method provided by the SDK to push a new page in their route.

```dart
khalti.open(context); // Assuming that khalti is a variable that holds the instance of `Khalti`.
```

## Payment verification API
A payment verification API that confirms the status of the payment made, is already called by the SDK internally. However, if the users receive `needsPaymentConfirmation` as true in `onMessage` callback, they are supposed to called the payment verification API manually to be sure about the payment status. It can be done with a method provided by the `Khalti` instance.

```dart
await khalti.verify(); // Assuming that khalti is a variable that holds the instance of `Khalti`.
```

The instance of `Khalti` is provided in the `onPaymentResult` and `onMessage` callback which can be used to invoke any public functions provide by `Khalti` class.

## Closing the Khalti payment gateway page
After payment is successfully made, developers can opt to pop the page that was pushed in their route. The SDK provides a `close()` method.

```dart
khalti.close(context);
```
